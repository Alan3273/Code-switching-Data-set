# Language Identification for Code-Switching Dataset
using Indian Languages: A Comparative Study of
N-gram, SVM, CNN, and BLSTM Models

Abstract—Challenges in the Identification of Automatic Language for Code-Switched Text: Experiment with Four Indian
Languages - Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, and Tamil. Abstract. Codeswitching is an ordinary phenomenon in multilingual communities. It gives some problems in the natural language processing
approach. In this paper, we put forward a deep and holistic
approach toward automatic language identification using N-gram
models, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural
Networks, and finally, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
Networks. The results obtained will provide a clear indication of
the capability of deep models in comparison to the traditional
methods, along with giving insight into their strengths and
weaknesses when handling code-switched text. The identification
and recognition of the languages in a conversation where there
is code-switching is quite tricky owing to the fact that more than
one language is employed in a single speech.
